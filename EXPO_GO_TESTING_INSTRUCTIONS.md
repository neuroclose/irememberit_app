## üîç Debugging Tips

### Check Console Logs
If issues persist, shake your device and tap "Show Developer Menu" ‚Üí "Debug Remote JS" to see console logs.

### Look for these log messages:
- `[API] Fetching from: https://touchupui.preview.emergentagent.com/api/proxy/...`
- `[Leaderboard] Fetching leaderboard data...`
- `[Announcements] Marking announcement as read...`

### Common Issues

**Issue:** App still shows old behavior
**Solution:** Force close Expo Go completely and reopen, then reload the app

**Issue:** "Network request failed"
**Solution:** Check that your device and development machine are on the same network

**Issue:** QR code won't scan
**Solution:** Use the manual URL entry option instead
