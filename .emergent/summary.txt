The AI engineer systematically addressed numerous critical issues across the  application. The trajectory began with resolving a  in , moving into complex data consistency problems regarding user subscriptions and organization tiers, particularly where web API data was misaligned. Significant effort was dedicated to improving user authentication flows, specifically implementing robust error handling and UI feedback for login and signup, including auto-scrolling on error. Environment-level challenges, like Git repository corruption, were also tackled. Furthermore, the engineer fixed announcements (mark as read functionality, correct data field usage), adjusted UI elements (removing tab bar labels, hiding N/A ranks), and performed a comprehensive overhaul of module classification logic on the home screen, iteratively adapting to actual API data (, ) after initial assumptions proved incorrect.

<product_requirements>
The iRememberIT mobile learning platform requires a Dual Account Architecture (Standalone/Organization) with JWT authentication. It must support learning sessions, progress tracking, and gamification (points, rank, leaderboard, badges, streaks), with data synchronization via FastAPI/MongoDB and an external web API. Authentication features include signup, login, email verification, and password reset. The profile page needs to show user roles. A subscription management page is essential, displaying current subscriptions, upgrade/cancel options, with seat management handled by the web. Branding must be consistent. A tailored post-verification welcome modal is required. Standalone learners should see total time spent learning instead of a leaderboard. Subscription options should be visible for standalone users and organization admins only. Promo code validation and application with defined tiers are essential, along with Stripe integration for checkout.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was actively resolving issues related to **module classification on the home screen**. The user reported that modules were not displaying or were incorrectly categorized as assigned or unassigned.

The problem evolved through several diagnostic and fixing attempts. Initially, logic was based on  (expected to be 'assigned'/'unassigned') and then on . However, API logs showed all modules consistently returned , and a direct  field was absent on modules. This indicated a mismatch between expected data and actual API responses.

The current work focused on identifying the correct data field for classification. It was discovered that the  field within the module data, as returned by the backend sync API, is the key differentiator. The latest change modified the module filtering logic in . Modules with  are now designated as assigned, and others are unassigned. This fix directly addresses the user's report by aligning the frontend display with the authoritative data from the API. The frontend has been restarted to apply these changes, and the next step is to verify the correct display of modules based on this new logic.
