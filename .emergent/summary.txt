The AI engineer's work within this trajectory has been extensive, focusing primarily on refining the iRememberIT application's user experience and functionality across several critical areas. Initially, the engineer addressed user feedback on the subscription page, aiming to reorder tiers and implement seat management, but later reversed seat management to direct users to the web version. A significant effort was dedicated to branding consistency (iRememberIT), enhancing the signup flow with account type selection and conditional fields, and subsequently fixing multiple related backend API proxy issues and frontend data passing.

A welcome modal was introduced post-email verification, with logic to differentiate messages for personal (free) vs. team (trial) accounts and suggest popular upgrades. Gamification elements were tackled, integrating streak information onto the dashboard and correcting badge icon display. Numerous API communication errors were debugged, ranging from missing backend proxy endpoints for signup and email verification to incorrect endpoint paths for streak, subscription, and promo codes, which led to 400 and 500 errors. The subscription  query was temporarily disabled due to an unavailable web API endpoint. The latest work identified that Stripe checkout URLs are successfully generated by the backend, but the frontend isn't opening them, marking a crucial pending task for completing the subscription upgrade flow.

The iRememberIT mobile learning platform features a Dual Account Architecture (Standalone/Organization Users) with JWT authentication. Key functionalities include learning sessions (Fill-in-Blank, Word Cloud, Verbal Speaking) with immediate feedback, progress tracking, and gamification (points, rank, leaderboard, badges, streaks). Data synchronization with FastAPI/MongoDB and an external web API is crucial. Existing features encompass module creation (manual text, file upload, speech-to-text), UI enhancements (leaderboard, profile, home screen with progress bars), Edit Profile, Organization Settings, and Announcements with push notifications.

The authentication system transitioned to email/password with JWT, including new flows for signup, login, email verification (with auto-polling), and password reset. The profile page shows user roles. The ongoing objective is a subscription management page displaying current subscriptions, upgrade/cancel options, and initially, seat management for organizations (later deferred to web). Branding consistency (iRememberIT) and a tailored post-verification welcome experience are also required. Standalone learners should not see a leaderboard but a total time spent learning card, and subscription options should be visible for standalone users and organization admins only. Promo code functionality needs to be integrated, including validation and application logic, with defined tiers, types, duration, and messages. Stripe integration for checkout and subscription management is essential.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was addressing an issue where clicking Upgrade to Premium on the subscription page resulted in spinning wheels and no further action, despite backend logs confirming that Stripe checkout sessions were successfully created and Stripe URLs were being returned. The core problem identified is that the frontend application is not opening these Stripe checkout URLs. This suggests a missing or incorrectly implemented client-side navigation or linking mechanism within the  component that should handle the received Stripe URL to redirect the user for payment. The  query on the frontend has been temporarily disabled (, ) due to prior 500 errors from the  endpoint, as the backend does not expose this directly from the web API, instead requiring subscription data from . The  endpoint in the backend is correctly returning the Stripe URLs, but the frontend interaction with this response is incomplete.
