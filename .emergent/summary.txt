The AI engineer was tasked with fixing module classification on the home screen. The process involved extensive debugging due to a mismatch between expected module data () from  and the actual data returned by the web API. Initial attempts in  to use  and  proved inconsistent because the API consistently returned . After iterative logging and user clarification, the logic was adjusted to classify modules based on  as unassigned and  as assigned. It was ultimately determined that the frontend logic was correct, but the web API was not consistently returning the expected  values, specifically for Tonight Commitment 10/27.

The iRememberIT mobile learning platform requires a Dual Account Architecture (Standalone/Organization) with JWT authentication, supporting learning sessions, progress tracking, and gamification (points, rank, leaderboard, badges, streaks). Data synchronization occurs via FastAPI/MongoDB and an external web API. Key authentication features include signup, login, email verification, and password reset. The profile page must display user roles. A subscription management page is crucial, showing current subscriptions, upgrade/cancel options, with seat management handled by the web. Branding must be consistent. A tailored post-verification welcome modal is necessary. Standalone learners should see total time spent learning instead of a leaderboard. Subscription options are visible for standalone users and organization admins only. Promo code validation, application with defined tiers, and Stripe integration for checkout are essential. The current focus is on correctly classifying and displaying modules as assigned or unassigned on the home screen.

- : FastAPI backend, primarily acting as an API proxy.
    - **Summary**: Handles backend logic and proxies specific API calls to an external web API.
    - **Changes**: Improved error handling for the  endpoint. Examined for general proxy handlers and specific  endpoint.
- : Tab navigation layout.
    - **Summary**: Configures the bottom tab bar and global header.
    - **Changes**: Set  to remove tab labels and hid rank badges if  is invalid.
- : Home screen, displaying modules and announcements.
    - **Summary**: Central screen for user's learning modules.
    - **Changes**: Significant iterative refinement of module classification logic. Initially,  and  were considered. The final iteration explicitly uses  for Unassigned and  for Assigned sections, with extensive logging added for debugging.
- : Frontend API configuration.
    - **Summary**: Defines API base URLs and authentication keys.
    - **Changes**: Examined to confirm that  directly calls the external web API on native platforms.
- : Frontend API service.
    - **Summary**: Centralized service for all frontend API calls.
    - **Changes**: Modified Axios interceptor to exclude login from token refresh. Corrected API paths for  and  to include  prefix.  method was confirmed to call .
- : TypeScript type definitions.
    - **Summary**: Defines interfaces for data models including .
    - **Changes**: Added  to the  interface.

Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was addressing the user's explicit request to fix module classification on the home screen. The core issue was that modules like Tonight Commitment 10/27 were expected to be classified as assigned but appeared as unassigned.

Initial investigation showed a discrepancy between the  (expecting  to differentiate) and the actual API response, where all modules initially returned . The logic in  was initially using  for classification, then briefly , due to the API's consistent  return.

After a crucial user clarification (personal=unassigned, assigned=assigned), the  logic was updated to strictly classify based on the  field. However, even after multiple API refreshes, two key modules, Tonight Commitment 10/27 and This is just a test card to show up in the app 2, consistently returned  from the web API. Only Test Card to Show in App1 eventually updated to .

The conclusion reached is that the frontend classification logic in  is now correctly implemented according to the user's definition. The remaining inconsistency stems from the external web API not returning the expected  for Tonight Commitment 10/27. The mobile app is now correctly processing the data it receives.

<optional_next_step>
Verify the frontend module classification, noting that the web API must return  for Tonight Commitment 10/27 to appear as assigned.
