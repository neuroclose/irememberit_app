## Notes for Web API Implementation

   - First Name
   - Last Name  
   - Email
   - Company
   - Job Title
   - Profile Photo (optional)

2. **Organization Fields**: Based on the web version screenshots:
   - Organization Name
   - Logo (optional)
   - Primary Color (hex code)
   - Accent Color (hex code)

3. **Announcements**:
   - Should support creation by admin users only
   - Should include read/unread status per user
   - Optional expiration date
   - Should trigger push notifications when created

4. **Push Notifications**:
   - When an announcement is created via `POST /api/mobile/organizations/{orgId}/announcements`
   - The backend should send push notifications to all users in that organization
   - Use Expo Push Notification service
   - Notification should include: title, body (content preview), and data (announcementId)

## Mobile App Implementation Status

### ‚úÖ Completed
- Edit Profile screen (`/edit-profile`)
- Organization Settings screen (`/organization-settings`) - Admin only
- Announcements list screen (`/announcements`)
- Create Announcement screen (`/create-announcement`) - Admin only
- Profile page updated with new navigation
- Backend proxy endpoints created for all new endpoints
- API service methods added

### ‚è≥ Pending
- Announcement badge in header with unread count
- Announcement popup on app launch for unread announcements
- Push notifications setup (requires Expo push token configuration)

## Testing

Once the web API endpoints are implemented, test using:
1. Edit Profile: Navigate to Profile ‚Üí Edit Profile ‚Üí Update fields ‚Üí Save
2. Organization Settings: Navigate to Profile ‚Üí Organization (admin only) ‚Üí View/Update settings
3. Announcements: Navigate to Profile ‚Üí Announcements ‚Üí View list ‚Üí Create new (admin)

Expected behavior:
- Profile updates should sync back to web version
